# IELTS_PracticeAndEvaluation
IELTS is a globally recognized English language proficiency test designed to assess the language skills of individuals who aim to study, work, or migrate in English-speaking countries. The test consists of four main modules: **Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking,** each evaluating different language abilities to provide a comprehensive overview of a candidate's English proficiency. The scores obtained in these modules contribute to an overall IELTS band score, ranging from 1 to 9, with 9 being the highest proficiency level.

Similarly PTE a.k.a Pearson Test of English, is an English language proficiency test similar to IELTS, recognized globally for academic and immigration purposes. PTE assesses candidates through Speaking and Writing, Reading, and Listening modules. Both tests serve as reliable measures of English language proficiency, but PTE is known for its computer-based format and quicker result turnaround compared to IELTS.
